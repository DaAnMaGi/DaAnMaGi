<h1> Hi! I'm David Marimón👋</h1>
</div>

Enchanted to meet you! I'm a psychologist who found a new passion in the world of data, its exploration, transformation and analysis as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. 

I love POP music🎵, connecting with people👥, a good joke🙌, learning new things🧑‍🎓 and, of course, programming!🧑‍💻

<h2> How did I ended up in the IT world?🌎 </h2>
</div>    

I always have love technology, so when my work as a psychologist connected me with the Big Data World, I found myself wanting to know more on how to be part of that world!🧜 Which I ended up doing when decided to start a new journy as a Data Scientist!

<h2> Projects!💼 </h2>
</div>   

- **[Steam & Machine Learning - Henry](https://github.com/DaAnMaGi/Proyecto_Marzo)**: Here, I worked to developed a Recomendation Model item-user, consumable through the Web for Steam Users! To achieve this goal, I trained a Machine Learning model, using the library scikit-surprise from Python and deployed the system using Railway and FastAPI.

- **[Traffic accidents - Henry](https://github.com/DaAnMaGi/Proyecto_Data_Abril)**: This project had the purpose of analysing the data of Deaths from Traffic Accidents in the City of CABA (Ciudad de Buenos Aires) between the 2016 and 2021 to identify patterns and trends that allow to develop new strategies that reduces said number of deaths. I transformed and analysed said data in Python, to then consume it in a Dashboard made in PowerBi.

- **[USA Gastronomic Industry](https://github.com/Batxa/DS_ProjectFinal)**: We looked to offer a Recomendation Model and a dashboard that helped USA's restaurants and bars owners. This project, which was developed using a Scrum-Agile methodoly, worked in 3 sprints: a first one in which we explore and transform the data using Python and its libreries Pandas y Numpy, a second one where we automatized the proccess of transforming the data with AirFlow, uploading it in the Web through Google Cloud Platform; and a thrid one, where we created the Recomendation Model deployed in Streamlit and a Dashboard using Looker Studio.
