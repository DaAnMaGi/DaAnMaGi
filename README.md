<h1> Hi! I'm David Marimón👋</h1>

Enchanted to meet you! I'm a psychologist who found a new passion in the world of data, its exploration, transformation and analysis as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. 

I love POP music🎵, connecting with people👥, a good joke🙌, learning new things🧑‍🎓 and, of course, programming!🧑‍💻

<h2> How did I ended up in the IT world?🌎 </h2>
</div>    

I have always loved technology, so when my work as a psychologist connected me with the Big Data World, I found myself wanting to know more about how to be part of that world!🧜 Which I ended up doing when I decided to start a new journey as a Data Scientist!

- **[Steam & Machine Learning - Henry](https://github.com/DaAnMaGi/Proyecto_Marzo)**: Here, I worked to develop a Recommendation Model item-user, consumable through the Web for Steam Users! To achieve this goal, I trained a Machine Learning model using the scikit-surprise library from Python and deployed the system using Railway and FastAPI.

- **[Traffic accidents - Henry](https://github.com/DaAnMaGi/Proyecto_Data_Abril)**: This project aimed to analyze the data of deaths from traffic accidents in the City of CABA (Ciudad de Buenos Aires) between 2016 and 2021 to identify patterns and trends that could help develop new strategies to reduce the number of deaths. I transformed and analyzed the data in Python, then visualized it in a Power BI dashboard.

- **[USA Gastronomic Industry](https://github.com/Batxa/DS_ProjectFinal)**: We aimed to offer a Recommendation Model and a dashboard to help USA's restaurant and bar owners. This project, developed using a Scrum-Agile methodology, consisted in 3 sprints: first, we explored and transformed the data using Python and its libraries Pandas and Numpy; second, we automated the data transformation process with AirFlow, uploading it to the web through Google Cloud Platform; and third, we created the Recommendation Model deployed in Streamlit and a dashboard using Looker Studio.
